This directory serves as an API for accessing and updating data related to the pub-game Billiards.
It is used as a part of the BiljartLine application,
which in turn may be used to document and categorise many aspects of the Billiards sport.
This directory specifically relates to Federations, Competition, Teams and Players.

The BiljartLine application was made as a clone of biljartpoint.nl for a school project.
It is not intended to be used IRL or to infringe on the existing implementation of biljartpoint.nl.
